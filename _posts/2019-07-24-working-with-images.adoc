:page-excerpt: In this guide several ways will be explored on how to interact with images in a CUBA application

:java_version: 1.8
:cuba_version: 7.0


In a CUBA application it is possible to interact with images in various ways. In this guide, examples will be shown on how
to upload and display images in the application. It will also be shown how to attach those images to entities and providing
 the user the ability to download the image files from the application.

== What Will be Built

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA Petclinic] example to allow the user to attach with images to entities and interact with them. In particular the following changed will be made:

* allow to upload an image for a Veterinarian
* render the vets image in the vets browse table
* create custom lookup-like component that shows the vets image next to the vets name
* ability to attach x-ray images to a visit and show a preview of the images

=== Final Application

== CUBAs File Storage Subsystem Handles File Interactions

CUBA has a comprehensive set of features, that deal with the task of interacting with files within an application called `File Storage`.
This set of APIs allow the developer to fulfill the end-to-end process of working with files. It contains mainly:

* ability to let the users upload files
* store references from business entities to files
* read & write files in the application
* ability to let users download files

The default implementation of the File Storage subsystem stores metadata about the file in the relational database and the
raw file binary in the local filesystem.

More information about this topic can be found in the reference documentation on https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/file_storage.html[File Storage].

As an Image is just a particular type of a file, it is possible to treat the image handling just like any other kind of file handling
with some specific additional behavior like preview in the browser.
