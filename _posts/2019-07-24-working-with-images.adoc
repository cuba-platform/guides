:cuba_version: 7.0


In a CUBA application it is possible to interact with images in various ways. In this guide, examples will be shown on how
to upload and display images in the application. It will also be shown how to attach those images to entities and providing
 the user the ability to download the image files from the application.

== What Will be Built

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA Petclinic] example to allow the user to attach with images to entities and interact with them. In particular the following changed will be made:

* allow to upload an image for a Veterinarian
* render the vets image in the vets browse table
* create custom lookup-like component that shows the vets image next to the vets name
* ability to attach x-ray images to a visit and show a preview of the images

=== Final Application

== CUBAs File Storage Subsystem Handles File Interactions

CUBA has a comprehensive set of features, that deal with the task of interacting with files within an application called `File Storage`.
This set of APIs allow the developer to fulfill the end-to-end process of working with files. It contains mainly:

* ability to let the users upload files
* store references from business entities to files
* read & write files in the application
* ability to let users download files

The implementation of the File Storage subsystem separates the storage of the file metadata from the file binary. It stores
metadata about the file in the relational database and the raw file binary in the local filesystem.

More information about this topic can be found in the reference documentation on https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/file_storage.html[File Storage].

As an Image is just a particular type of a file, it is possible to treat the image handling just like any other kind of file handling with some specific additional behavior like preview in the browser.

== Veterinarians Avatar Image


The first example of this Images guide allows the users to upload & display an avatar image for a particular veterinarian.

In order to achieve this behavior, the data model of the Petclinic example needs to be enhanced, to store a reference to a file for the `Vet` entity. The corresponding JPA entity that is bundled in CUBA itself is called `FileDescriptor`, which represents the metadata part of the file representation. The association type is `MANY-TO-ONE`. In the Studio entity designer, the result looks like this:

image::working-with-images/vet-entity-file-descriptor-reference.png[align="center"]

Once the entity model contains the reference to the `FileDescriptor` entity, the attribute `image` has to be added to the view, in order to interact with this attribute in the UI.

The view `vet-with-specialties` for the `Vet` entity, that is used within the Vet editor, has to be changed to contain the `image` attribute like this:


.views.xml
[source,xml]
----
<view class="com.haulmont.sample.petclinic.entity.vet.Vet"
      extends="_local"
      name="vet-with-specialties-and-image">
    <property name="specialties"
              view="_minimal"/>
    <property name="image" view="_base" />
</view>
----

With this adjustment it makes sense to also rename the view name to `vet-with-specialties-and-image` to reflect the content of the view.

=== Upload Vets Avatar Image


With those preconditions in place, the next step is to adjust the Vet editor, so that it also contains the ability to upload an image during the process of creating / editing a Vet record.

CUBA has a built-in UI component for dealing with `FileDescriptor` instances - the FileUploadField component. This component can be added to the already existing `<form />` component from in the `vet-edit.xml` screen descriptor:

.vet-edit.xml
[source,xml]
----
<form id="fieldGroup" dataContainer="vetDc">
    <column width="250px">

        <textField property="firstName"/>
        <textField property="lastName"/>

        <upload id="imageField"
                property="image" // <1>
                fileStoragePutMode="IMMEDIATE"
                showFileName="true"
        />

    </column>
</form>
----
<1> the FileUploadField component binds the uploaded file to the `image` attribute of the `vetDc` data container

There are a couple of options for the upload component to control its behavior, that can be looked up in the https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/gui_FileUploadField.html[reference documentation]. For this use-case, the default behavior is sufficient. It will allow the user during the process of creating / editing an Vet instance, to upload, download, remove and re-upload files and directly attach it to this particular vet instance.

The resulting user interface looks like this:

image::working-with-images/vet-entity-file-descriptor-reference-ui.png[align="center"]

The attribute `fileStoragePutMode` set to `IMMEDIATE` leads to the behavior that the file is persisted and a corresponding persisted `FileDescriptor` instance is created directly after the upload of the file is completed. It has the benefit, that this behavior allows to link the Vet instance to the image without further programmatic interaction.

However, this has the side effect, that even if the vet instance is not saved, the file will still be kept in the system. It can still be found via `Administration > External Files`. If this behavior is not desired, the `fileStoragePutMode` has to be set to `MANUAL`, which requires manual management of the file persistence. An example of this behavior can also be found in the reference documentation on https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/file_upload.html[File upload].

=== Display Vets Avatar Image in the Browse Table

The next example that deals with the Vets avatar image is that the uploaded file should be displayed in the Vet browse screen. In order to do that, the `image` attribute has to be part of the corresponding view (which it is from the change above).

In order to display an image in a screen the second UI component in this space is the `<image />` component. It allows to render an image based on various sources, which includes:

* Image from the classpath
* Image from the filesystem
* Image from an arbitrary URL
* Image from a `FileDescriptor` instance

See https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/gui_Image.html[CUBA docs: Image UI component] for more information on the possible options.

In this use-case, since the `Vet` instance holds the reference to a `FileDescriptor` instance via the `image` attribute, it is possible to directly render the image out of the file reference that was stored during the last step.

The target UI should look like this:

image::working-with-images/vet-avatar-browse-screen.png[align="center", link="/guides/images/working-with-images/vet-avatar-browse-screen.png"]

The `image` attribute should be one of the columns in the vets table. Furthermore it should render a particular representation of the image: not the instance name of the `FileDescriptor`, but rather the image itself.

In order to achieve this behavior, the `table` component has a particular API method: `addGeneratedColumn`, which allows to define a `Component` for a particular column in the table.


.VetBrowse.java
[source,java]
----
public class VetBrowse extends StandardLookup<Vet> {

    @Inject
    protected GroupTable<Vet> vetsTable;

    @Inject
    protected UiComponents uiComponents;

    @Subscribe
    protected void onInit(InitEvent event) {
        vetsTable.addGeneratedColumn("image", this::renderAvatarImageComponent); // <1>
    }

    private Component renderAvatarImageComponent(Vet vet) {
        FileDescriptor imageFile = vet.getImage(); // <2>

        if (imageFile == null) {
            return null;
        }

        Image image = smallAvatarImage();

        image.setSource(FileDescriptorResource.class)
                .setFileDescriptor(imageFile); // <4>

        return image;
    }

    private Image smallAvatarImage() {
        Image image = uiComponents.create(Image.class);  // <3>
        image.setScaleMode(Image.ScaleMode.CONTAIN);
        image.setHeight("40");
        image.setWidth("40");
        image.setStyleName("avatar-icon-small");
        return image;
    }

}
----
<1> a new column `image` is registered in the `vetsTable` with the factory method: `renderAvatarImageComponent`
<2> the `image` `FileDescriptor` reference is retrieved from the `Vet` instanced
<3> the UI infrastructure bean `uiComponents` is the entry point for creating UI components programmatically
<4> the Image component is bound to the `FileDescriptor` through the `FileDescriptorResource` variant

With this code in place, a image component is created, configured and bound to the `FileDescriptor` instance. With the corresponding style name `avatar-icon-small`, the image is rendered as shown above.
