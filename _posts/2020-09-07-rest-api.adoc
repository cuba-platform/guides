In this guide you will learn how to create REST APIs for a CUBA application. We will explore mechanisms to create different types of APIs by adding Owner registration to the Petclinic as well as allow third-party applications to control the visit management.

== What we are going to build

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA Petclinic] example so that Owners can self-register online before the Visit. In the second example we will allow a third party tablet application to do the visit management via a custom secured REST API.

include::includes/guide_requirements.adoc[]

== Overview

Providing an API for an application is oftentimes a good way to foster machine to machine communication. CUBA supports various forms of API technologies through its strong foundation in form of the Spring Framework. Spring has native support for creating REST and SOAP-Webservice based APIs. Also, newer technology approaches like GraphQL are possible with the help of the wider Java ecosystem.

Additionally, CUBA offers dedicated support for REST APIs via a generic API, which allows to manage the complete application entity model through automatically available endpoints.

In this guide we will focus on creating multiple REST based HTTP APIs in order to allow other applications interact with the CUBA Petclinic.
During the examples we will work with both the generic API and custom HTTP endpoints based on the use-case at hand.

== What is a REST API

Before exploring the details of the CUBA implementation of proving an API, let's quickly talk about what a REST API looks like and what the concepts behind it are.

A REST API is an HTTP based API (HTTP being the protocol, that is the underpinning of a big part of the Internet) with some specific usage of it. REST in particular has a couple of building blocks, that we will use throughout this guide.


Generally speaking an API is a mechanism to let different systems communicate with each other and exchange data. The API then is the defined interaction mechanism in which those two applications can communicate. To make it more concrete, take the analogy of a restaurant:

TIP: The menu that the restaurant offers is the API. Once you order a piece from the menu, you are doing an API call with a more or less structured interaction format ("I take number 25", "Pizza is out, sorry!", "Something to drink?"). The response of that API call is the food which is delivered from the kitchen.

Let's unfold the concepts which REST defines as one particular style of an API:

=== Resources

A Resource is something that you can think of like an abstraction on the concept of any kind of information. Examples of a resource can be an image, a document or a dish in a menu. In can also be a Pet, but not the actual Pet. It would be rather a virtual representation of it in the Petclinic application. Resources are identified by something called a Resource Identifier. In its concrete form a resource identifier is something like a URL: `https://petclinic.cuba-platform.com/pets/123` to identify the Resource: The pet with the Identification Number: 123.

=== Resource Verbs

Verbs on Resources represent the "operations" that you can perform on a particular resource. In REST those Verbs should form a uniform interface (abstract definition). In the concrete in HTTP there are a couple of Verbs, that can be used in order to interact with a resource:

* `GET https://petclinic.cuba-platform.com/pets/123`: fetches information about the Pet with the Identification Number 123
* `PUT https://petclinic.cuba-platform.com/pets/123`: updates information about the Pet with the Identification Number 123
* `POST https://petclinic.cuba-platform.com/pets`: adds a new Pet to the list of existing Pets

There are a handful of verbs defined in HTTP that can be used. All of them have a particular meaning, although their interpretation and usage
is oftentimes up to the provider of the API.

Generally the Verbs have different characteristics / guarantees associated to it. E.g. the verb `GET` normally is used for loading data. By the HTTP specification a `GET` operation is _idempotent_ and _safe_. Roughly speaking this means that the operation in the API should not have side effects. Also, applying the same operation twice should not lead to a different outcome. Loading information about a Pet is generally possible to do multiple times without having a side effect. Therefore, using the `GET` verb for this operation is matching the guarantees the `GET` verb offers.

Registering a Pet on the other hand twice would lead to having two Pets stored in the application. Therefore, this operation is not side-effect free. For those kinds of operations the `POST` verb would be a better fit, as this verb does not give guarantees about side-effect freeness.

There are several verbs defined in HTTP. The primary ones are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.

== Requests and Responses

Requests and responses conceptually are not described by REST, but they are a very integral part of an HTTP based API. Requests and responses are the actual interactions that happen between the client and the server of an HTTP interaction. A request is the initial message from the client to the server. The response on the other hand is the resulting message from the server to the client. Both interactions normally contain two parts: the message payload and the message metadata.

Here is an example of how an HTTP request & response interaction looks like:


.Example HTTP Request for creating a Visit
[source,http]
----
POST http://petclinic.cuba-platform.com/rest/api/visits //<1>
Authorization: Bearer 71dbb8a8-2a41-45e7-a73b-16a96c433651
Content-Type: application/json // <2>

{ // <3>
  "petIdentificationNumber": "025",
  "visitStart": "2020-04-05T08:00:00",
  "visitEnd": "2020-04-05T10:00:00",
  "type": "REGULAR_CHECKUP",
  "description": "This is a regular checkup for Pikachu"
}
----
<1> the Verb + Resource identifier to express what operation should be performed
<2> the `Content-Type` describes to the server on how to interpret the message payload
<3> the payload / body of the request containing the business relevant information

After the server has received the HTTP request, it would e.g. produce the following response:

.Corresponding HTTP Response indicating a Visit was created
[source,http]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 // <1>
Content-Type: application/json

{ // <2>
  "id": "4e3bde19-c0ec-7cd0-654a-577ba32dcc7f"
}
----
<1> `200` indicates the response code to categorize the outcome of interaction
<2> the response message (body) contains the actual business relevant information (visit identifier in this case)


The message payload of an API interaction oftentimes uses the JSON format, as seen above. That being said, it is possible to exchange different message formats through HTTP as well, like `XML`, or `www-url-formencoded`. Also, binary formats are possible (to transfer PDF documents / images).

With this general information, we can now point our focus on how to convert those abstract descriptions into real working APIs in a CUBA application.

== How to create an HTTP Controller

In the next section, we will take a look into the concrete usage of the HTTP inside a CUBA application. CUBA is based on Spring, which offers dedicated support for providing HTTP APIs. In particular Spring MVC is responsible for offering that functionality.

In order to create a HTTP endpoint it is necessary to create a Java class and annotate it with `@RestController`. In order to fulfil the implementation of the API operation `GET https://petclinic.cuba-platform.com/pets/123`, a method needs to be annotated with `@GetMapping` in order to connect it to a particular endpoint.

Here you find an example of such a REST Controller in Spring MVC:

.FetchPetController.java
[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController // <1>
public class FetchPetController {

    @GetMapping("/pets/{petId}") // <2>
    public ResponseEntity<Pet> fetchPet(
        @PathVariable("petId") String petId // <3>
    ) {

        final Optional<Pet> possiblePet = dataManager.load(Pet.class)
            .query("e.identificationNumber = ?1", petId)
            .optional();

        if (!possiblePet.isPresent()) {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }

        return ResponseEntity.ok( // <4>
            possiblePet.get()
        );
    }
}
----
<1> Registering the class as a HTTP / REST controller
<2> the `fetchPet` method links to the endpoint `GET /pets/{petId}` via the `@GetMapping` annotation
<3> the `petId` part of the URL is dynamic and gets passed into the method as a parameter
<4> ResponseEntity takes care of returning the correct HTTP status code and HTTP response body

For the different HTTP verbs Spring MVC provides the corresponding Annotations, as we will see in later code listings.

One part of the HTTP message metadata is the response code. Those codes are used to indicate the client different outcomes of the operation. The response code `200 - OK` is indicating a successful operation, whereas `404 - Not Found` tells the client that the resource that was requested is not available. There are several response codes that can be used to very precisely describe the outcome of an operation.

The `ResponseEntity` is responsible for controlling what HTTP response is returned to the client. It on the one hand describes the metadata like the response code, but is also used to define the response body. In the example above a Pet object is treated as the response body. Spring MVC takes care of converting the Pet object into a JSON format and returns it to the HTTP client.

== REST API for Petclinic

In this section we will look into the CUBA Petclinic application and how we can create REST APIs for it in order to let other applications interact with the Petclinic.

For most of the examples we will leverage the https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/rest-api/[CUBA REST API addon]. In the Petclinic example it is already included. If you use the example as a starting point for your own implementation, make sure you add the addon to your application via the CUBA Marketplace.

All example requests for testing out the solution can be found in the https://github.com/cuba-guides/{project_id}/blob/master/requests[requests] directory in the example project. This directory contains multiple example requests to see the interaction with the API.

image::rest-api/http-request-example.png[Example HTTP request, link="images/rest-api/http-request-example.png"]

TIP: When using CUBA Studio together with https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate], those request examples can be used to directly interact with the running CUBA application via the corresponding "Play" button next to the request. It allows to interactively use the API and see the actual HTTP requests and responses.

A new application called `PetTreat` will be used at the Petclinic by Vets and Nurses on their tablet. `PetTreat` should support the employees performing the treatments of the pets. In order to achieve this, the tablet application needs to communicate with the `CUBA Petclinic` application. Furthermore, the data that is handled in `PetTreat` should be updated accordingly in the `CUBA Petclinic` application to be accessible to all employees.

After an initial exploration of the required functionality, the following data interactions with the Petclinic were identified:

* Search Pets by Name
* Create a Visit for a Pet
* See information about an already existing Visit
* Start & end a Treatment during a Visit

As these kinds of information and operations are very sensitive, it is required to only allow the corresponding Vets and Nurses to interact with the `CUBA Petclinic` system through `PetTreat`. As the information should be available immediately for all other employees at the Petclinic after it was entered in PetTreat, an API in the Petclinic will be used for the interactions between `PetTreat` and CUBA Petclinic.

CUBA offers solutions for those requirements through the above mentioned Spring MVC APIs as well through the generic REST API addon. In this example we will look into both solutions and compare the implementation of them.

In order to support the authorization requirements, we will start by looking into CUBA OAuth2 implementation, which is a mechanism to authenticate users through the API.

=== CUBA OAuth2 API Authentication

OAuth2 is a common internet standard for providing an authentication mechanism for API interaction. CUBA supports the OAuth2 authentication framework out of the box via its https://doc.cuba-platform.com/restapi-latest/[REST API addon]. The way the authentication via OAuth2 works is the following:

1. the client makes a request providing the login credentials (username and password) in order to retrieve access token
2. the access token is send as a short living credential, that is send with every request as a HTTP header to authenticate further requests

An example request for performing the login and retrieve the access token looks like this:

.HTTP Access Token Request
[source,http]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/oauth/token
Authorization: Basic {{cubaRestClientId}} {{cubaRestClientSecret}}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=password&username={{username}}&password={{password}}
----

TIP: The text that is expressed in double curly braces like `{{username}}` are variables that should be replaced by the actual values. E.g. `username` and `password` need to be replaced by the actual username and password of the user to login.

This HTTP POST request will, given correct credentials, respond with the following JSON containing the access token:

.HTTP Access Token Response
[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token": "56b53dab-0988-4480-84ae-5690bdf713dd",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "refresh_token": "44727aca-07d7-4363-b545-d2801502d01b",
  "expires_in": 43199,
  "scope": "rest-api"
}
----

The value of the `access_token` fields needs to be stored in the client application and used for further requests. After the authentication step is done, it is possible to interact with the REST API in an authenticated way. This means further requests that are performed with this access token act as the user that originally requested the token.

In particular CUBA now takes the complete security subsystem into consideration like the Roles as well as the Access Group which the user is currently associated with. As a concrete example, if the user is inside an access group, that only allows to see Pets of the type `Water`, the same restriction is populated through the API.

You can find more information on the different security related topics in the addon documentation:

* https://doc.cuba-platform.com/restapi-latest/#rest_api_v2_ex_get_token[OAuth 2 Authentication]
* https://doc.cuba-platform.com/restapi-latest/#security[REST API Security]

The next step is to go through the functional requirements for `PetTreat` and see how to perform those operations through an API.
We will start off with the generic API approach directly available via the REST API addon.

=== Custom API operations

The first approach on how to create those APIs is to define custom REST controllers as shown above via Spring MVC. Lets go through the four scenarios and see how to tackle one-by-one.

==== Registering custom Controllers in CUBA

The first step is to not only create a Spring MVC controller, but also registering it to the CUBA application and to put it under the security umbrella, that we have seen above.

For that we need to create a file called `rest-dispatcher-spring.xml` under `com/haulmont/sample/petclinic` package within the `web` module. It contains the configuration of the custom API:

.rest-dispatcher-spring.xml
[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
      xmlns:security="http://www.springframework.org/schema/security"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.3.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-4.3.xsd">


  <context:component-scan
    base-package="com.haulmont.sample.petclinic.web.controller" // <1>
  />

  <security:http
    pattern="/rest/api/**" // <2>
    create-session="stateless"
    entry-point-ref="oauthAuthenticationEntryPoint"
    xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/security">
    <!-- Specify one or more protected URL patterns-->
    <intercept-url
        pattern="/rest/api/**"
        access="isAuthenticated()"
    />
    <anonymous enabled="false"/>
    <csrf disabled="true"/>
    <cors configuration-source-ref="cuba_RestCorsSource"/>
    <custom-filter ref="resourceFilter" before="PRE_AUTH_FILTER"/>
    <custom-filter ref="cuba_AnonymousAuthenticationFilter" after="PRE_AUTH_FILTER"/>
  </security:http>

</beans>
----
<1> activate automatic searches for `@Controller` annotated controllers in the `controller` sub-package
<2> configure authentication for the route `/rest/api/**` and all controllers that are put under this prefix

After creating this file, it needs to be registered within the `web-app.properties` file like this:

.web-app.properties
[source,properties]
----
cuba.restSpringContextConfig = +com/haulmont/sample/petclinic/rest-dispatcher-spring.xml
----

With this configuration in place, we are able to create our first controller inside the `controller` package.

==== Retrieving Pet and Visit information

==== Creating a Visit for a Pet

==== Starting and Stopping a Visit Treatment


=== REST addon for generic API

The four requirements of looking up data from Pets and Visits, as well as creating visits and starting a treatment can be achieved through the generic REST API.

Before showing how it works, let's quickly go through the idea behind the generic API from the REST API addon.

With the help of the addon, the CUBA application provides an API for performing CRUD operations for all entities out of the box. There is no need to write code on the server side to expose the entity data as an API. Also, for similar operations like creating or updating an entity the generic API will provide this capability.

It is also possible to expose CUBA services directly via this generic API only by registering the business service in a configuration file `rest-services.xml`.


==== Retrieving Visit information

For retrieving the Visit Information through the generic API, the following HTTP GET request can be performed:

.Retrieve Pet Information
[source,http]
----
GET http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/petclinic_Visit // <1>
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}} // <2>


HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

      "version": 1,

      "identificationNumber": "198"
    }
  },
  {

      "id": "4100306c-49cd-0961-bfa3-c50859f1e6c4",
      "version": 1,
      "name": "Smogon",
      "identificationNumber": "109"
    }
  }
]
----
<1> the URL path `entities/petclinic_Visit` indicates which entity data to load
<2> the access token needs to be passed to every request in order to perform the authentication
<3> the response contains a list of all Visits

==== Filtering for Pets by Name

The generic API also provides an endpoint to perform searches for entities. It is possible to define filter criteria similar to how you would do it in the generic Filter UI component. Filtering for the Pet with the name "Pikachu" can be done like this:

.Search for Pet by Name
[source,http]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/petclinic_Pet/search
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}

{
  "filter": { // <1>
    "conditions": [
      {
        "property": "name",
        "operator": "=",
        "value": "Pikachu"
      }
    ]
  },
  "view": "pet-with-owner-and-type" // <2>
}


HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

[ // <3>
  {
    "_entityName": "petclinic_Pet",
    "_instanceName": "025 - Pikachu",
    "id": "d83cc7f7-69b5-3830-ff1d-ed74d1e4a79c",
    "owner": {
      "_entityName": "petclinic_Owner",
      "_instanceName": "Ash Ketchum",
      "id": "351eb2d2-c70b-3af7-109c-2b19a5929101",
      "lastName": "Ketchum",
      "address": "Miastreet 134",
      "city": "Alabastia",
      "telephone": "00497688166348",
      "firstName": "Ash",
      "email": "ash-ketchum@example.com"
    },
    "type": {
      "_entityName": "petclinic_PetType",
      "_instanceName": "Electric",
      "id": "d390dc26-3462-7586-221a-3110f0fcd97c",
      "name": "Electric"
    },
    "birthDate": "1998-01-03",
    "name": "Pikachu",
    "identificationNumber": "025"
  }
]
----
<1> the filter definition is send as the HTTP POST body
<2> a view can be specified for defining which data is returned
<3> the HTTP response contains the entry list that match the search criteria

With this very flexible API it is possible to perform all kinds of queries against the list of entities. More information can be found in the https://doc.cuba-platform.com/restapi-latest/#rest_api_v2_ex_search_filter[docs].

With those two endpoints, the API fulfils the requirements to view & search all kinds of Visit and Pet data in the `PetTreat` application.

==== Creating a Visit for a Pet

The next operation to create a visit can be performed through the generic Entities API as well.

For creating a Visit the following HTTP POST request needs to be performed:

.Create a Visit
[source,http]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/petclinic_Visit
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}

{ // <1>
    "visitStart": "2020-10-14 08:30:00.000",
    "visitEnd": "2020-10-15 10:00:00.000",
    "description": "Surgery created via API",
    "type": "RECHARGE",
    "pet": {
      "id": "d83cc7f7-69b5-3830-ff1d-ed74d1e4a79c" // <2>
    }
}


HTTP/1.1 201 // <3>
Location: http://localhost:8080/petclinic/rest/v2/entities/petclinic_Visit/a1aa87cb-c68f-ef2f-a69a-a685eeb2dd0c
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{
  "_entityName": "petclinic_Visit",
  "id": "a1aa87cb-c68f-ef2f-a69a-a685eeb2dd0c" // <4>
}
----
<1> the Visit information are send as the HTTP body
<2> links to other entities like the `Pet`are created by ID references
<3> the HTTP response is `201 - Created` for a valid request
<4> the result contains an ID of the newly created Visit


==== Starting and Stopping a Visit Treatment

The last API operation that `PetTreat` needs is the ability to start / finish a Visit treatment. In the entity model, this operation is expressed via a status field of the Visit entity called `treatmentStatus`. Therefore, it is possible to perform an update on the Visit entity respectively.

The following request will start the treatment of a Visit:


.Start a Visit treatment
[source,http]
----
PUT http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/petclinic_Visit/{{visitId}} // <1>
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}

{
    "treatmentStatus": "IN_PROGRESS" // <2>
}


HTTP/1.1 200
----
<1> an HTTP PUT request is performed against the URI of the Visit
<2> the fields to update are send through the request body

Finishing a treatment can be done with the same HTTP request, but instead of sending `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE` is send for the `treatmentStatus` field.

=== Pros & Cons of using generic vs. custom API

Custom API:
* Ability to control HTTP interaction (custom Status Code, error responses etc.)
* Decoupling between entity model and API model when using custom REST API
* Non CRUD possibilities when using custom REST API

Generic API:
* Speed of Development
* additional functionality (search, views, queries, pagination, Swagger etc.)
* Service Exposure for non-CRUD operations
