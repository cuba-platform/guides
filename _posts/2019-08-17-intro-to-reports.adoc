CUBA applications can be enhanced to have a comprehensive report / document generation capability directly embedded into the application. The CUBA application component `reports` supports various file formats like `docx`, `xlsx`, `PDF`, `HTML` for templating as well as output file formats. Furthermore it contains management screens and provides APIs to interact with the report / document generation process programmatically.

In this guide the reports application component will be introduced and different ways to interact with it through the UI and programmatically will be shown.

== What Will be Built

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA Petclinic] example to show how report capabilities can be embedded into the application:

* a `recent-visits` report can be downloaded from the visit browse screen. The report contains visits of the last month, exported as an excel sheet with information about the visit, the referenced pet and its owner.
* a `patient-record` word document containing all relevant information (master data, visit data) for a given pet can be downloaded through the detail screen of the pet.

== Overview

Oftentimes when working with business applications there is a high demand for document generation, that will take some information from the source application and bring it in the form of a commonly known format, so that it can be shared with other parties like customers, partners or other systems.

These documents might either have the form of human consumable content like a PDF file or are more used as input data for further use like a CSV / Excel file or a Word document.

CUBA being targeted towards the needs of business applications in particular has dedicated support for this kind of use cases through the `reports` application component.

It has the ability to define formatted document templates and declare the data that should be used for the document. This definition is done in a declarative way, that does not require development of code in order to generate reports / documents. It is possible for developers as well as administrators and business users with mid-level technical skills.

=== Example Use Cases

As mentioned above there are lots of example use cases, that deal with generating documents / reports out of a source application. Here's a list of examples:

* create a excel sheet of the TOP 10 of customers with the highest total turnovers
* generate an invoice document for an order stored in the application in PDF format
* create payment data file as a CSV file for file exchange between the payment system and the BI system
* show a list of best selling products aggregated by category as an application screen
* create HTML file of latest sales offers in order to upload & publish this file on a website

All of those requirements are part of what the `reports` application component is capable on handling. In the next section the overall concepts are covered and afterwards example use cases are implemented.

== Templates + Data = Document

The underpinning of this whole solution is based on on the combination of document templates with data, that are merged in order to create the resulting document / report.

=== The Document Template
The document template is a file that acts as the blueprint for how the target file should look like. It contains placeholders as particular text snippets, that the `reports` application component can pick up and put the data into the document.

Those placeholders can inserted as regular text into the template file, but they need a special characters to indicate that this text is a placeholder. A placeholder is defined in the following form: `${NAME_OF_PLACEHOLDER}`

An example of a document template can be seen below. This example is an excel sheet, that is used later in this guide:

image::intro-to-reports/excel-document-template-example.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/excel-document-template-example.png"]

The template contains regular text as well as the placeholders for the different columns in the table like `${pet.name}` or `${pet.identificationNumber}`.

Furthermore it is possible to style and adjust the document template in whatever ways is desired. For Word and Excel documents, all the possible formatting options of those programs are able to be applied to the template file. For HTML documents the complete capabilities of CSS can be used for applying styles to the target document.

TIP: The template file format are not necessarily the file formats of the output document. It is possible to e.g. have a Word based document template that will generate a PDF file when merged with the data.

=== Data Sources

The data that is used for the report can be of various sources. Within a CUBA application fetching the data directly from the entity layer of the application is the most convenient variant. However, the reports application component is not bound to this particular data source. It can be one of the following data sources:

* CUBA Entities / JPQL
* SQL
* Groovy
* JSON

This various sources allow a high degree of flexibility when it comes to fetch data and provide it to the template file. It is also possible to define multiple data sources and combine all the data in the template.

== Report Configuration

Once the data sources are defined and connected through a concept called Bands to particular template placeholders, everything is setup to generate the output document. The application component stores all of this configuration in the entity `Report` which holds the configuration of the data sources together with the definition of the templates and further configuration information.

image::intro-to-reports/report-entity-configuration-screen.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-entity-configuration-screen.png"]

There are two main ways of creating those report records.

The first one is to create an instance manually and defining the data sources together with the associated JPQL / SQL queries / groovy scripts.

This is oftentimes needed when more complex reports should be defined which requires skills to create SQL / JPQL statements or even programming abilities through groovy scripts. This option
is mostly for administrators that have a deep technical understanding of the inner workings of the application. It furthermore requires knowledge about its domain model and an understanding of the technical concepts of the report application component like report bands, report parameters etc.

=== The Report Wizard

The second option is to use the report UI wizard that guides the user through the selection of various options. It includes the ability to define the conditions for entities to be selected for the report, the attributes that should be included. Furthermore it generates a base template which contains already the selected attributes as placeholders.

image::intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-1.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-1.png"]

image::intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-2.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-2.png"]

image::intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-3.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-3.png"]

This variant is targeted more towards business users, since it hides away the technical details of e.g. the query definition behind a user-friendly configuration UI. For easier reports, this wizard can serve as the main UI for creating reports by business users directly.

With the feature of generating a document template that contains the correct placeholders of the selected attributes is allows the business users to only change the formatting of the output document. This template formatting normally happens in the application that they are already familiar with like Word or Excel. The main difference is that this opens up possibilities for non-technical people to work with reports without the need of any developer interaction.

That being said also for tech-savvy people it is oftentimes the fastest way to create a report it is or at least a starting point for manual adjustments.

One constraint for the report wizard is that it is tied to generating reports / document based on the CUBA entity layer. Groovy / SQL based reports cannot _directly_ be created through the wizard. However, it is possible to use the wizard report as a first step and then adjust the resulting report's bands accordingly through the regular management screen.


=== External Parameters

A Report configuration can declare external parameters that need to be provided by the person or application code that interacts with the report. Those parameters are mainly used for the data fetching parts. In the JPQL / SQL statements as well as the groovy based data bands, those parameters are passed in to dynamically inject the values into the query / the groovy script.

The configuration of the external parameters in the Report configuration screen looks like this:

image::intro-to-reports/report-entity-configuration-external-parameters.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-entity-configuration-external-parameters.png"]

When external parameters are defined, the values can be entered in two ways. The first way is to expose this parameters as a form in the generic UI. It will appear at the point when the report is executed through the generic Report execution UI. An example of such a UI can be seen here:

image::intro-to-reports/report-external-parameters-dynamic-ui.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-external-parameters-dynamic-ui.png"]

== Recent Visits Report

The first document that should be generated by the application is the `recent-visits` report. It should be accessible as a download directly from the visit browse screen. The report contains visits of the last month, exported as an excel sheet with information about the visit, the referenced pet and its owner.

In order to fulfill this requirement the first step is to create a report via the Report Wizard. The following main settings are set:

* Report Entity: `Visit (petclinic_Visit)`
* Template Type: `XLSX`
* Report Name: `Vists by Period`
* Report Type: `Report for list of entities, selected by query`


The next step is to define the query. The report Wizard allows to set the query by defining conditions through the UI.

In this report the visits of the last month should be selected. However the concept of "relative dates" is not present in the report application component directly. Due to this, this piece of logic has to be externalized to the code that triggers the report run.

The report itself is going to be a little more generic in the sense that it allows to specify a period that defines the date range of the visits that will be taken into consideration. This furthermore has the benefit that the report potentially is re-usable for other future use-cases.

The query consists of two conditions for the attribute `visitDate`. It should match a value that is within an range of two dates: "Visit Date Range Start" and "Visit Date Range End". The only difference between the two conditions is that for the first condition the "operation" is `greater or equal than: >=` while the second condition has the operation `smaller than: <`. With that, the boundaries of the range are expressed as conditions.

image::intro-to-reports/visit-by-period-date-range-creteria.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/visit-by-period-date-range-creteria.png"]

For each condition an external parameter will be created so that the concrete values can be inserted programmatically or alternatively by the user through a UI.

=== Selecting Entity Attributes of the Visit Entity

The next step in the wizard is to define the attributes of the base entity (Visit) and its associated entities that should be part of the report. The selection will influence on the one hand the `SELECT` part of the JPQL statement that is used to fetch the data. On the other hand it influences the initial version of the columns within the template, that is generated for this report when finishing the report wizard.

For the `recent-visits` Report, the following attribute should be selected:

* Visit Date: `visitDate`
* Visit Description: `description`
* Information about the associated Pet
** the Pets' name: `pet.name`
** the Pets' Identification Number: `pet.identificationNumber`
** Type of the Pet: `pet.type.name`
** The city where the Pet lives (expressed through the address of its owner): `pet.owner.city`

After selecting the attributes through the UI wizard, the output template file type can be configured. In this example, the default settings are applicable.

With that the report wizard is finished and the report configuration is shown for further adjustments.

=== Providing External Parameters Programmatically

For the use case of the `recent-visits` report the generic UI is not exposed to the user. Instead the parameters are passed in by the API call to run the report.

The complete listing for the triggering of the `recent-visits` report shows the main steps of:

1. identifying the last month (externalized logic of relative date)
2. loading the report instance to execute
3. triggering the report execution and passing in the last month as a parameter


.VisitBrowse.java
[source,java]
----

public class VisitBrowse extends StandardLookup<Visit> {

    @Inject
    protected ReportGuiManager reportGuiManager;

    @Inject
    protected DataManager dataManager;

    @Inject
    protected TimeSource timeSource;

    @Subscribe("visitsTable.lastMonthReport")
    protected void onVisitsTableLastMonthReport(Action.ActionPerformedEvent event) {

        TimeRange visitDateTimeRange =
                MonthYearValue
                        .fromDate(today())
                        .minusMonths(1); // <1>

        reportGuiManager.printReport( // <2>
                loadReportByCode("visits-by-period"), // <3>
                ParamsMap.of( // <4>
                        "visitDateRangeStart", visitDateTimeRange.getStart(),
                        "visitDateRangeEnd", visitDateTimeRange.getEnd()
                        )
        );
    }

    private LocalDate today() {
        return timeSource.now().toLocalDate();
    }

    private Report loadReportByCode(String reportCode) {
        return dataManager.load(Report.class)
                .query("select e from report$Report e where e.code = :reportCode")
                .parameter("reportCode", reportCode)
                .one();
    }

}
----
<1> the last month based on today's date is identified
<2> `reportGuiManager.printReport` is the API for starting the execution of a report and downloading it immediately
<3> the correct report instance needs to be loaded from the database. Here it is fetched by relying on the `code` attribute value
<4> a parameter map is passed in containing the start and end date range parameter of the report through the `MonthYearValue` object

The main part for passing in the external parameters is the definition of the last month:

`TimeRange visitDateTimeRange = MonthYearValue.fromDate(today()).minusMonths(1);`.

The `TimeRange` class is a custom abstraction of the example
application that provides an API to define a Time Range (either a MonthYear range or a Quarter range) and has methods to get the border values of
the range.

After the definition of the values for the parameters, the `reportGuiManager.printReport` has the ability to pass in a Map of parameters.
The keys of the Map have to match the `parameterAlias` value of the parameter as configured in the Report Entity.

== Patient Record

The second report that should be generated is a patient record for a given pet. It contains an overview of the pet's master data as well as visit data form that pet.

In this case the document template will be a Word document. However, the target document will be a PDF file.

The report will have the following default settings:

* Report Entity: `Pet (petclinic_Pet)`
* Template Type: `DOCX`
* Report Name: `Patient Record`
* Report Type: `Report for single entity`


=== Defining the Attributes

The direct master data of the pet are similar to what has been selected in the `recent-visits` report, basically the data of the Pet entity as well as the associated Owner entity.

In order to display a list of associated visits of this Pet entity, another data band has to be created. This is possible during the initial Report wizard.

In the second step after initially defining the direct attributes of the entity, it is possible to create additional "regions" in the report. Those regions basically translate to a particular data bands that is generated out of those selections.


image::intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-add-tabular-section.png[align="center", link="images/intro-to-reports/report-entity-wizard-add-tabular-section.png"]

In order to select the `visits` attribute here, it is required to have this relationship in the domain model. Currently the `Pet` entity does not have an association / composition reference to the visits. Instead the reference is only expressed from the Visit entity to the Pet entity.

By adding a 1:N composition attribute `visits` to the Pet entity, it is possible to select this reference in the report wizard in order to create the second region in the report for the visit related data.

// TODO: show example created second band


=== Configuring the Output document

// TODO: show template section of "Report Configuration"

// TODO: switch template to PDF

=== LibreOffice for accurate Word to PDF conversion

After configuring the output document to be PDF, adjustments need to be made in the configuration of the application. In order to increase the accuracy of the PDF ouput document, CUBA is able to leverage the conversion facilities of LibreOffice.

LibreOffice has an API that other programs can use to convert different file formats (especially PDF file generation). The `report` application component uses that API when LibreOffice is installed on the operating system and configured in the CUBA application properties.

// TODO: explain config properties

== Summary

In this introduction to the report and document generation topic, the building blocks of the CUBA application component `reports` were explained.
A report is the concept that allows to merge a document template with data from data sources to produce an output document / report.
Both building blocks: the document template as well as the data sources can be of various kinds. With that it provides a high degree
of flexibility when configuring reports to generate output documents.

All this configuration is hold in the main entity: `Report`, which can be created through a UI wizard or manually.
With that it supports users with different levels of technical capabilities.

A report can be run directly through a generic user interface, or programmatically throughout the code of the application.
It is possible to define external parameters, that get passed into the report. With that, reports can be configured in a
more generic manner to support multiple use-cases.
