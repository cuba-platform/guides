== What Will be Built

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA petclinic] example to show how localized messages within the CUBA application can be defined and used:

* The application is also available in German and Russian language
* Dynamic data as automatically generated descriptions for visits are localized

=== Final Application

== Localized Messages

CUBA applications have build-in support for localized messages for different languages. Translations are externalized in
properties files to have a clear separation between the application code and the translated messages.


== Where Translations are Stored in a CUBA Application

CUBA deals with translations as it is common for other Java based applications. Messages for different languages / locales are stores next to the source-code within the same package in `.properties` files.

For every language and every package there exists a file containing information on how to translate a given text into the target language. The language files contain a suffix according to the locale code of the language (e.g. `_ru` for russian, `_es` for spanish).

An example of this file structure looks like this:

```
com.haulmont.sample.petclinic.entity
|
├── owner
│   ├── Owner.java
│   └── messages.properties
├── pet
│   ├── Pet.java
│   ├── PetType.java
│   ├── messages.properties
│   ├── messages_de.properties
│   └── messages_ru.properties
├── vet
│   ├── Specialty.java
│   ├── Vet.java
│   ├── messages.properties
│   ├── messages_de.properties
│   └── messages_ru.properties
└── visit
    ├── Visit.java
    ├── VisitType.java
    ├── messages_de.properties
    ├── messages_ru.properties
    └── messages.properties
```

The properties file contains of key-value pairs, where the key is the identifier of the to be localized string and the value is the corresponding translation for the language.

The key is the same for all language files, only the value differs. In the example of the petclinic, localized entity and entity attributes names look like this:

.messages.properties
[source, java]
----
Pet.birthDate = Birth date
Pet = Pet
Pet.type = Type
Pet.owner = Owner
Pet.identificationNumber = Identification Number
PetType = Pet Type
----

.messages_de.properties
[source, java]
----
Pet.birthDate = Geburtstag
Pet = Haustier
Pet.type = Typ
Pet.owner = Tierhalter
Pet.identificationNumber = Haustier-Identifikationsnummer
PetType = Tierart
----

The example application contains translations for english, german and russian languages.

More information about the general structure of how localized messages are stored can be found in the reference documentation: https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/localization.html[Localization].


== Register Available Languages in the Application

In order to activate the possibility to select different languages as a user, the application needs two main configuration options in place. The first one is the activation of the language drop-down in the login screen and settings screen of the app: `cuba.localeSelectVisible`. It has to be set to `true`. The second configuration is the available languages / locales that should be available for selection: `cuba.availableLocales = English|en;German|de;Russian|ru`.

Both configurations should be placed in the `web-app.properties`. With that in place the Login screen will display the language selection box:


image::i18n-messages/login-screen-with-activated-language-selection.png[align="center"]

When logging in as a user with a given language, the application will display the translations of the corresponding language.
This happens automatically for all UI components if the corresponding translation files are in place. A `<form>` component e.g. renders the attribute captions localized:

image::i18n-messages/localized-editor.png[align="center"]


== Referencing Localized Messages

For the two cases of `<groupTable />` and `<form />` the translation are automatically derived from the properties that should be displayed. For other UI components or messages throughout the application, there are two ways of interacting with the Localization mechanisms of CUBA: either in the XML screen definitions or programmatically from the Java code.

In order to display the correct localized message for the language the user selected, the message keys have to be referenced in the application code in order to render the correct String.

=== Referencing Messages in XML Descriptors

The first option is to reference a particular message key within XML UI descriptor. In the petclinic example, the button caption of the "regular checkup" button should be displayed in the selected language.

.visit-browse.xml
[source,xml]
----
<groupTable id="visitsTable"
            dataContainer="visitsDc"
            width="100%">
    <actions>

        <action id="createRegularCheckup"
                caption="msg://createRegularCheckup" // <1>
                icon="font-icon:BRIEFCASE" />

    </actions>
    <buttonsPanel id="buttonsPanel"
                  alwaysVisible="true">
        <button id="createForPetBtn" action="visitsTable.createRegularCheckup"/>
    </buttonsPanel>
</groupTable>
----
<1> `msg://createRegularCheckup` references the key `createRegularCheckup` in the current package of the XML descriptor

=== Programmatic Localization of Messages

The second way of interacting with the Localization mechanism is imperatively through Java code. In the Petclinic example, the "regular checkup" button should render the following two dynamic messages programmatically:

1. When a new Regular Checkup screen is opened, the description attribute for the visit entity should be pre-filled with a particular localized message
2. Once the Regular Checkup is created, a localized notification message should be rendered, containing the name of the pet

Messages can be received via the `Messages` Interface. It provides an API to fetch a translated String through the localization mechanism of CUBA for the locale of the current user.

TIP: In the example code instead of using the `Messages` Interface, the `MessageBundle` Interface is used. It is a new shorthand mechanism introduced in CUBA 7.0, that fetches a particular message from the message pack of the calling Java class. This way it is not required to provide the package for every translation API request.


The first localized message for pre-filling the description attribute is created as follows:


.VisitBrowse.java
[source,java]
----
public class VisitBrowse extends StandardLookup<Visit> {

    @Inject
    private Notifications notifications;

    @Inject
    private MessageBundle messageBundle;

    // ...

    private void createVisitForPet(Pet pet) {
        screenBuilders.editor(visitsTable)
                .newEntity()
                .withInitializer(visit -> {
                    visit.setDescription(
                        regularCheckupDescriptionContent(pet) // <1>
                    );
                    visit.setPet(pet);
                })
                .withScreenClass(RegularCheckup.class)
                .withLaunchMode(OpenMode.DIALOG)
                .withAfterCloseListener(event -> showRegularCheckupCreatedNotification(pet))
                .build()
                .show();
    }

    private String regularCheckupDescriptionContent(Pet pet) {
        return messageBundle.formatMessage( // <2>
                "regularCheckupContent", // <3>
                pet.getName(), // <4>
                pet.getIdentificationNumber()
        );
    }
----
<1> the description of the visit instance will be set on entity creation
<2> the `messageBundle` bean fetch the translated message
<3> `regularCheckupContent` is the key of the message to be translated
<4> the Parameters `pet.getName()` and `pet.getIdentificationNumber()` are passed to the translation as parameters

If dynamic parts of a message should be rendered, the translation should contain placeholders like in this definition:


.messages_de.properties
[source,properties]
----
regularCheckupContent=Kontrolluntersuchung für %s (%s)\n\n

Bestandteile: \n
- Krallen-Kontrolle\n
- Temperatur messen\n
- Zahn-Check
----

This code results into the following description value of the regular check:

image::i18n-messages/editor-with-programmatic-created-i10n-messages.png[align="center"]


The second message should be displayed as a notification once the "regular checkup" was successfully created. There is
 the method `showRegularCheckupCreatedNotification` in the Visit browser, that will be called once the instance is created:


.VisitBrowse.java
[source,java]
----
public class VisitBrowse extends StandardLookup<Visit> {

    // ...

    @Inject
    private MetadataTools metadataTools;

    @Inject
    private MessageBundle messageBundle;

    @Inject
    private Notifications notifications;


    private void showRegularCheckupCreatedNotification(Pet pet) {

        String petName = metadataTools.getInstanceName(pet); // <1>

        String regularCheckupCreatedMessage = messageBundle.formatMessage("regularCheckupCreated", petName); // <2>

        notifications.create(Notifications.NotificationType.TRAY)
                .withCaption(regularCheckupCreatedMessage) // <3>
                .show();
    }
----
<1> `metadataTools` are used in CUBA 7.0+ to fetch the instance name from an entity
<2> The `messageBundle` is used once again to get a particular message with a parameter
<3> the localized Message String is passed to the `notifications` bean to render a TRAY notification


== Translation of Existing UI Screens / Functionality

Since CUBA comes with certain UI components and with multiple UI screens that are available out of the box, this existing functionality needs also to be localized in order to have a fully translated application. For this problem, there are two main solutions:

1. Community Languages Packs
2. Manual providing Translations


=== Community Language Packs

The first and most easy solution is to use existing Language packs that are created by the community. There are currently twelve Translations available including Spanisch, Russian, French, Chinese, German and a lot more. The translation cover around half of the worlds population.

WARNING: The Community Translations Packs are provided by the community, therefore the accuracy and the catch up with the latest changes in the platform differ and are provided as best effort.

In order to get those translations into the Application they can be fetched manually from the https://github.com/cuba-platform/translations[CUBA Translations Github repository]. Some Translations are also directly available via an application component through the https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace/[CUBA marketplace],
which makes the installation as easy as installing any other application component.

Afterwards, the new language has to be added to the application property `cuba.availableLocales`.

=== Manual Providing Translations

In case the target language is not available through the community or some Translations are missing or are not accurate, it is also possible to provide those translations directly within the application.

CUBA itself provides translations for the screens directly in the source code of the platform as regular `*.properties` files. The User browse screen for example contains the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba/blob/master/modules/gui/src/com/haulmont/cuba/gui/app/security/user/browse/messages.properties[messages.properties] file in the package `com.haulmont.cuba.gui.app.security.user.browse`,
which contains the translations for the screen.

In order to provide / override translations for this screen, the same package (and module) has to be created in the application. In this directory the additional / replacing message files are placed. CUBA will pick up the file and display the correct translations for the screen.


TODO: provide example in the Petclinic project on how some values for englisch are replaced for the User Browse screen

== Summary

CUBA supports Localization of Applications out of the box. It provides a subsystem that allows application builders to provide different Languages / Locales for the application. The application can be provided in different Languages on a per-user basis.

A Message key is used in the application code to reference a localizable Message, which will at runtime translated into the destination language. There are several ways to interact with the Localization subsystem. In this guide the declarative XML based reference was shown as well as the programmatic reference via the `MessageBundle` Interface.

There are existing Translations available in the platform itself and provided by the Community, to also cover the Translations of platform features & screens like the administration screens.
