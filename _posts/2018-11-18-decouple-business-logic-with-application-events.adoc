This guide walks you through the CUBA mechanism to use events in your application. Events are a common pattern within an application to decouple one part of the business logic from another.


== What will be build

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA petclinic] example to show different use cases regarding programmatic data access with the DataManager API. In particular, the following use cases will be covered:

* automatic creation of a Visit for a given Pet Identification Number
* automatic sending out of "Disease Warning Mailing" for endangered pets

=== Final Application

== Sync vs. Async. Communication in software

== Available types of Events in a CUBA application

* Entity Lifecycle Events (`EntityChangedEvent`)
* Application Lifecycle Events (`AppStartedEvent`)
* Custom Application Logic Events (`MyEvent extends ApplicationEvent`)

=== EntityChangedEvent for executing decoupled business logic on entities



=== Execute logic on the global application lifecycle

=== Custom Application Logic events

== Constrains of Events in a CUBA application

=== Sending global events within an CUBA application



== Summary

The application events from CUBA allow to define loosely coupled business logic within the application. Independent parts from a business functionality point of view can also be reflected as independent components within the application. This low coupling
