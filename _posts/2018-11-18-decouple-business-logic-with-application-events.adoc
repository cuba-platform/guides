This guide walks you through the CUBA mechanism to use events in your application. Events are a common pattern within an application to decouple one part of the business logic from another.


== What will be build

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA petclinic] example to show different use cases of application events. In particular, the following use cases will be covered:

* sending out of "Welcome mailing" for newly registered pets
* notifying user after login about latest visits
* kicking off payment process once Pet Visit is marked as completed

=== Final Application

== Benefits of a event based business logic



== Available types of events in a CUBA application

There are different kinds of application events within a CUBA application. The main categories are:

* Entity Lifecycle Events
* Application Lifecycle Events
* Custom Application Events

The guide goes through all of the categories and lays out an example on how to use them.

=== Entity Lifecycle events: EntityChangedEvent

The first example is in the category of _Entity lifecycle events_. The `EntityChangedEvent` is send out by the CUBA storage mechanism, once an Entity has been changed in the database.

CUBA fires such an Event for entities, that have an annotation `@PublishEntityChangedEvents` on the Entity definition. A `EntityChangedEvent` contains information about the type of change (create, update or delete) as well as the attributes which have been changed.

Using the petclinic as an example the following logic will be implemented: Once a new Pet is created in the database, a "welcome mailing" should be send out to the pet owner as an email, which welcomes the pet as a new customer of the pet clinic.

To register a Event listener for this event, a new Spring bean in the core module of the application has to be defined. In order to register to a specific kind of event, the method that should be called once an `EntityChangedEvent` has been send has to be annotated with `@TransactionalEventListener`.


.WelcomeMailSender.java
[source,java]
----

@Component("petclinic_welcomeMailSender")
public class WelcomeMailSender {

    @TransactionalEventListener // <1>
    public void sendWelcomeMail(EntityChangedEvent<Pet, UUID> event) { // <2>

        if (event.getType().equals(EntityChangedEvent.Type.CREATED)) {

            Pet pet = loadPet(event.getEntityId()); // <3>

            tryToSendEmailToPetsOwner(pet);

        }
    }


    // ...

}
----

<1> registration of `showWelcomeMail` as an event listener
<2> scoping `EntityChangedEvent` only to Events which changed `Pet` entities
<3> access to `Pet` identifier of the created instance


With this definition of the Event listener the application will send out welcome emails to the owners of pets that have just registered in the petclinic.

==== Conventions of event based programming

Events are normally named in simple past: "Entity *Changed* Event". This is a common pattern, because it stresses that an event is a immutable fact that happened in the past and is not changeable anymore.

Event listeners instead should be named in present tense.

Furthermore Event listeners are normally named regarding the one specific action that they should fulfil. Instead of create a general `PetCreatedListener` that deals with all things that should happen once a pet is created in the system, Event listeners should be named regarding one specific action that should be performed: `WelcomeMailSender` -> send a welcome mail.

This leads to one major benefit of event based architectures: loose coupling. In case the example should be extended so that next to the welcome email a code is send to the mobile phone of the owner, which acts as the key for the petclinic room that the pet gets during its stay.

In case there would be a `PetCreatedListener` class, it would be natural to just put the logic in the class before or after the welcome email sending. Due to the fact, that it is named towards a specific action: `WelcomeMailSender` it does not feel very natural to put the logic in this class. Instead it is more logical to create another entity listener, that only fulfils the next requirement: `RoomCodeDistributor`.

This is an example of an application of the "open / closed principle", which normally lead to more loosely coupled application and due to that to more maintainable software.

=== Sending global events within an CUBA application



== Summary

The application events from CUBA allow to define loosely coupled business logic within the application. Independent parts from a business functionality point of view can also be reflected as independent components within the application. This low coupling
