In this guide you will learn how automated testing in a CUBA application works. In particular this guide deals with the question of how unit tests can be executed and when it makes sense to use them.

== What Will be Built

This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA Petclinic] example to show how existing features can be tested in an automated fashion via unit testing:

* display amount of Pets of a given Pet type for a particular Owner
* calculation of next regular checkup date proposals for a Pet

== Overview

In this guides you will learn how to use the techniques of unit testing without dependencies. This approach differs from the previously discussed variant of middleware integration testing, where a close-to-production test environment is created for the test to run.

In case of unit testing, the test environment is very slim because basically no runtime of the CUBA framework is provided. In return for giving up this convenience, unit testing allows you to more easily spin up the system under test and bring it to the proper state it needs to be to exercise the test case. It also cuts out a whole lot of problems regarding test data setup and is generally executed faster by orders of magnitude.

=== Unit Testing

Besides the integration test environment that you learned about in the middleware integration testing guide, it is also possible to create test cases, that do not spin up the Spring application context or any CUBA platform APIs at all.

The main benefits of writing unit test in an isolated fashion without an integration test environment are:

* locality of the test scenario
* test execution speed
* easier test fixture setup

In this case the class under test is instantiated directly via its constructor.
Since Spring is not involved on managing the instantiation of the class, dependency injection is not working in this scenario. Therefore dependencies (objects that the class under test relies upon) have to be instantiated manually and passed into the class under test directly.

In case those dependencies are CUBA APIs, they normally have to be mocked.

=== Mocking

Mocking / Stubbing is a common way in test automation that helps to emulate / control & verify certain external parts that the system under test interacts with in order to isolate the SUT as much as possible from its outside world.

<< INSERT IMAGE WITH SUT & DOC mocked out >>

As seen in the picture there is one class that acts as the system that should be tested (system under test: SUT). This class uses another class that is responsible for helping some additional need. This class is normally referred to as dependent-on-component (DOC).

What Stubbing or Mocking is doing now is the following:

In order to isolate the SUT from any other component to gain the test locality, the DOC is replaced with a fake object. This object plays the role of the real DOC, but in the test case you control the behavior of the fake object. With that you can directly influence how the SUT behaves even if it has some interaction with another dependency that would otherwise not be controllable directly.

==== Mocking Frameworks

JUnit itself does not contain Mocking capabilities. Instead dedicated Mocking frameworks allow to instantiated fake objects and control their behavior in a JUnit test case. In this guide you will learn about Mockito, a very popular Stubbing / Mocking framework in the Java ecosystem.


==== An Example of Mocking

The following example shows how to configure a mock object. In this case it will replace the behavior of the `TimeSource` API from CUBA which allows to retrieve the current timestamp. In this case the mock object should return yesterday. The way to define the behavior of a fake object in a JUnit Test case with Mockito looks like this:


.MockingTest.java
[source,java]
----
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) // <1>
class MockingTest {

  @Mock
  private TimeSource timeSource; // <2>

  @Test
  public void theBehaviorOfTheTimeSource_canBeDefined_inATestCase() {
    // given:
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now();
    ZonedDateTime yesterday = now.minusDays(1);
    // and: the timeSource Mock is configured to return yesterday when now() is called
    Mockito
        .when(timeSource.now())
        .thenReturn(yesterday); // <3>
    // when: the current time is retrieved from the TimeSource Interface
    ZonedDateTime receivedTimestamp = timeSource.now(); // <4>
    // then: the received Timestamp is not now
    assertThat(receivedTimestamp)
        .isNotEqualTo(now);
    // but: the received Timestamp is yesterday
    assertThat(receivedTimestamp)
        .isEqualTo(yesterday);
  }
}
----
<1> The `MockitoExtension` activates the automatic instantiation of the `@Mock` annotated attributes
<2> the `TimeSource` instance is marked as a `@Mock` and will be instantiated via Mockito
<3> the Mock behavior is defined in the test case
<4> invoking the method `now` returns yesterday instead of the correct value

The complete test case can be found in the example: https://github.com/cuba-guides/cuba-petclinic-unit-testing/blob/master/modules/core/test/com/haulmont/sample/petclinic/MockingTest.java[MockingTest.java]. With that behavior description in place, the one thing left is that the fake object instance is now manually injected into the class / system under test.

==== Constructor Based Injection

In order to achieve this one thing in the production code needs to be changed. Normally in CUBA Field based injection is used. This means that in case a Spring Bean A has a dependency to another Spring Bean B, a dependency is declared by creating a field in class A of type B like this:

[source,java]
----
@Component
class SpringBeanA {

  @Inject // <1>
  private SpringBeanB springBeanB; // <2>

  public double doSomething() {
      int result = springBeanB.doSomeHeavyLifting(); // <3>
      return result / 2;
  }
}
----
<1> `@Inject` indicates Spring to instantiate a SpringBeanA instance with the correctly injected SpringBeanB instance
<2> the field declaration indicates a dependency
<3> the dependency can be used in the business logic of A

In the context of unit testing, this pattern does not work very well, because the field can not be easily accessed without a corresponding method to inject the dependency. One way to create this dedicated injection method is Constructor based Injection. In this case the production code defines a dedicated Constructor, annotates it with `@Inject` and defines the desired dependencies as parameters in the Constructor.

[source,java]
----
@Component
class SpringBeanAWithConstructorInjection {

  private final SpringBeanB springBeanB;

  @Inject // <1>
  public SpringBeanAWithConstructorInjection(
          SpringBeanB springBeanB // <2>
  ) {
      this.springBeanB = springBeanB; // <3>
  }

  public double doSomething() {
      int result = springBeanB.doSomeHeavyLifting(); // <3>
      return result / 2;
  }
}
----
<1> `@Inject` indicates Spring to call the Constructor and treat the parameters as Dependencies
<2> the dependencies are defined as Constructor parameters
<3> the dependency instance is manually stored as the field

With that change in place, it is possible to call this constructor directly in the test case and pass in the mocked instance that was configured with the help of Mockito.

== Tests for Petclinic Functionality

Next you will see the different examples on how to use the unit test capabilities in order to automatically test the functionality of the Petclinic example project.

=== Pet Amount for a Particular Owner

The first test case deals with the feature of count the amount of pets that are associated to an Owner for a given Pet Type. This feature is used in the UI to display that number when the user selects one Owner in the corresponding browse screen.


image::unit-testing/pets-of-type.png[align="center"]

The following business rules describe the functionality:

* if the pet type of a pet matches the asked pet type the pet should be counted, otherwise not

==== Implementation

The implementation logic will be put into the Owner Entity class itself and exposed via a method `Owner.petsOfType(PetType petType)`.


.Pet.java
[source,java]
----
class Owner extends Person {
    // ...
    public long petsOfType(PetType petType) {
        return pets.stream()
            .filter(pet -> Objects.equals(petType.getName(), pet.getType().getName()))
            .count();
    }
}
----

It uses the Java 8 Streams API in order to iterate over the list of pets and filter out the ones that match on the Pet types name. Afterwards it counts the correctly identified pets.

==== Test Cases for the Happy Paths

We will start with the three test cases that verify the above described business rule.

.OwnerTest.java
[source,java]
----
class OwnerTest {

  PetclinicData data = new PetclinicData();
  private PetType electric;
  private Owner owner;
  private PetType fire;

  @BeforeEach
  public void initTestData() {
    electric = data.electricType();
    fire = data.fireType();

    owner = new Owner();
  }

  @Test
  public void givenOnePetWithElectricPet_whenAskingForElectricType_oneIsReturned() {
    // given:
    owner.pets = Arrays.asList( // <1>
        data.petWithType(electric)
    );
    // expect:
    assertThat(owner.petsOfType(electric)) // <2>
        .isEqualTo(1);
  }

  @Test
  public void givenOnePetWithElectricPet_whenAskingForFireType_zeroIsReturned() {
    // given:
    owner.pets = Arrays.asList(
        data.petWithType(electric)
    );
    // expect:
    assertThat(owner.petsOfType(fire))
        .isEqualTo(0);
  }


  @Test
  public void givenTwoElectricPetsAndOneFirePet_whenAskingForElectricType_twoIsReturned() {
    // given:
    owner.pets = Arrays.asList(
        data.petWithType(electric),
        data.petWithType(fire),
        data.petWithType(electric)
    );
    // expect:
    assertThat(owner.petsOfType(electric))
        .isEqualTo(2);
  }
}
----
<1> the pet's are defined for the owner
<2> `petsOfType` is executed with a particular pet type and the outcome is verified

The first test case is a positive test case, which contains the simplest amount of test fixture setup possible. Oftentimes it is a good idea to make the test data as small and clear as possible, because it shows better the essence of the test case.

The second test case is of the same kind but for a negative expectation. The third test case is a combination of both test cases.

This means that in this scenario this test case will not help to catch problems in the implementation that other test would not have found. In quality assurance terms, this test case lives in the same equivalent class as the other tests. This test case has more documentary purposes over actual regression.

With those tests in place, we have covered all code paths that are living along the happy path. This is a term, that describes normally the code execution path that works with valid input values and no error scenarios.

But if we think a little bit outside of that happy path, we will find a couple of more test cases, that are waiting to be written.

==== Testing Edge Cases

When considering the edge cases of the API that the method provides, there are multiple error scenarios to consider.

Just imagine the following situation: The `LookupField` in the UI does not require a Pet Type to be entered. If the user uses that and does not select a Pet Type and clicks OK the passed in `PetType` will be `null`. What happens in this case in the implementation? It will produce a `NullPointerException`. Thinking about edge cases in tests is very valuable, because it normally reveals bugs in the implementation that would otherwise normally only be found at runtime of the application.

To deal with that behavior that we will now create a test case, that proves this hypothesis:

.OwnerTest.java
[source,java]
----
class OwnerTest {
  // ...
  @Test
  public void whenAskingForNull_zeroIsReturned() {
    // expect:
    assertThat(owner.petsOfType(null))
        .isEqualTo(0);
  }
}
----

By defining that edge case, we also defined the expected behavior of the API. In this case we defined the return value should be zero. Running the test case shows the existence of the `NullPointerException` in this situation.

With that knowledge and test case that will tell us when we have reached a success state, we can adjust the implementation to behave according to our specification:

.Owner.java
[source,java]
----
class Owner {
    public long petsOfType(PetType petType) {

        if (petType == null) {
            return 0L;
        }

        return pets.stream()
            .filter(pet -> Objects.equals(petType.getName(), pet.getType().getName()))
            .count();
    }
}
----

Running the test case once again, we will see that the application now is capable of dealing with "invalid" inputs and react to it accordingly.

The next edge case that is of similar kind is when one of the pets the owner owns has no Pet type assigned. This is possible due to the current implementation of the entity model, `Pet.type` is not required.

In this case, we would like to exclude those Pets from counting. The following test case will show the desired behavior:

.OwnerTest.java
[source,java]
----
class OwnerTest {
  // ...
  @Test
  public void petsWithoutType_areNotConsideredInTheCounting() {
    // given:
    Pet petWithoutType = data.petWithType(null);
    // and:
    owner.pets = Arrays.asList(
        data.petWithType(electric),
        petWithoutType
    );
    // expect:
    assertThat(owner.petsOfType(electric))
        .isEqualTo(1);
  }
}
----

Executing the test shows another `NullPointerException` in the implementation. The following change will make the test case pass:

.Owner.java
[source,java]
----
class Owner {
    public long petsOfType(PetType petType) {

        if (petType == null) {
            return 0L;
        }

        return pets.stream()
            .filter(pet -> Objects.nonNull(pet.getType())) // <1>
            .filter(pet -> Objects.equals(petType.getName(), pet.getType().getName()))
            .count();
    }
}
----
<1> the pets with a null type will be excluded before doing the comparison

With that the implementation and test cases are mainly complete. As you have seen, thinking about the edge cases is just as necessary as testing the happy path. Both variants are necessary to get to a complete test coverage and have a comprehensive test suite to rely upon.

TIP: The way to write the test case first to identify a bug / develop a feature / prove a particular scenario is called `Test driven development` - TDD. Using this workflow normally leads to very good test coverage. In the case of fixing a bug it also gives you a clear end point where you know that you have fixed the bug.

=== Next Regular Checkup Date Proposal

The first example is a functionality for the Petclinic project that allows the user to retrieve the information when the next regular checkup should be scheduled for a selected Pet. The next regular Checkup Date is calculated based on a couple of factors. The pet type determines the interval as well as when the last regular checkup has taken place.

The calculation is triggered from the UI in the Visit Edit screen. The proposed Date can be taken into consideration when creating a new Visit. As part of that logic triggered by the UI, the following service method is available, which contains the business logic of the calculation:

.RegularCheckupService.java
[source,java]
----
public interface RegularCheckupService {

  @Validated
  LocalDate calculateNextRegularCheckupDate(
      @RequiredView("pet-with-owner-and-type") Pet pet,
      List<Visit> visitHistory
  );
}
----


The implementation of the Service declares two dependencies that it needs in order to perform the calculation:


.RegularCheckupServiceBean.java
[source,java]
----
@Service(RegularCheckupService.NAME)
public class RegularCheckupServiceBean implements RegularCheckupService {

  final protected TimeSource timeSource;

  final protected List<RegularCheckupDateCalculator> regularCheckupDateCalculators;

  @Inject
  public RegularCheckupServiceBean(
      TimeSource timeSource,
      List<RegularCheckupDateCalculator> regularCheckupDateCalculators
  ) {
    this.timeSource = timeSource;
    this.regularCheckupDateCalculators = regularCheckupDateCalculators;
  }

  @Override
  public LocalDate calculateNextRegularCheckupDate(
      Pet pet,
      List<Visit> visitHistory
  ) {
    // ...
  }
}
----

The first dependency is the `TimeSource` API from CUBA which is needed to retrieve the current date. The second dependency is a list of `RegularCheckupDateCalculator` instances.

The implementation of the service does not contain all the logic for different Pet types within the `calculateNextRegularCheckupDate` method. Instead the Service knows about possible Calculator classes. It filters out the one calculator that can calculate the next regular checkup date for the Pet and delegates the to the found Calculator.

==== Testing the Implementation with Mocking

In order to instantiate the SUT: `RegularCheckupService`, we are forced to provide both of the declared dependencies in the Constructor:

* TimeSource
* List<RegularCheckupDateCalculator>

We will provide a Stub implementation for the TimeSource in this test case via Mockito.

For the list of the Calculators, instead of using a Mock instances, special test implementation will be used. As the Unit test for the `RegularCheckupService` should verify the behavior in an isolated fashion, the purpose of this test is not to test the different calculator implementation. Instead the test case is going to verify the corresponding orchestration that the Service embodies.

The Implementation of the Calculators will be tested in dedicated Unit tests for those classes.

==== Testing the Orchestration in RegularCheckupService

Starting with the test case for the `RegularCheckupService` the following test cases cover the majority of the orchestration functionality:

1. only Calculators that support the Pet instance will be asked to calculate the checkup date
2. in case multiple calculators support a Pet, the first one (based on the occurrence in the List) is chosen
3. in case no Calculator was found, next month as the proposed regular checkup date will be used

The implementation of the test cases is shown in the listing below.

TIP: The JUnit Annotation `@DisplayName` is used to better describe the test cases in the test result report. Additionally it helps to link the the test case implementation to the above given test case descriptions.

.RegularCheckupServiceTest.java
[source,java]
----
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class RegularCheckupServiceTest {
  //...
  @Mock
  private TimeSource timeSource;

  private PetclinicData data = new PetclinicData(); // <1>

  @BeforeEach
  void configureTimeSourceToReturnNowCorrectly() {
    Mockito.lenient()
        .when(timeSource.now())
        .thenReturn(ZonedDateTime.now());
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName(
      "1. only Calculators that support the Pet instance " +
      "will be asked to calculate the checkup date"
  )
  public void one_supportingCalculator_thisOneIsChosen() {
    // given: first calculator does not support the Pet
    RegularCheckupDateCalculator threeMonthCalculator =
        notSupporting(THREE_MONTHS_AGO); // <2>
    // and: second calculator supports the Pet
    RegularCheckupDateCalculator lastYearCalculator =
        supportingWithDate(LAST_YEAR); // <3>
    // when:
    LocalDate nextRegularCheckup = calculate( // <4>
        calculators(threeMonthCalculator, lastYearCalculator)
    );
    // then: the result should be the result that the calculator that was supported
    assertThat(nextRegularCheckup)
        .isEqualTo(LAST_YEAR);
  }


  @Test
  @DisplayName(
      "2. in case multiple calculators support a Pet," +
      " the first one is chosen to calculate"
  )
  public void multiple_supportingCalculators_theFirstOneIsChosen() {
    // given: two calculators support the Pet
    //   the order within the list is used for fetching the first suitable calculator
    List<RegularCheckupDateCalculator> calculators = calculators(
        supportingWithDate(ONE_MONTHS_AGO),
        notSupporting(THREE_MONTHS_AGO),
        supportingWithDate(TWO_MONTHS_AGO)
    );
    // when:
    LocalDate nextRegularCheckup = calculate(calculators);
    // then: the result is the one from the first calculator
    assertThat(nextRegularCheckup)
        .isEqualTo(ONE_MONTHS_AGO);
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName(
      "3. in case no Calculator was found, " +
      "next month as the proposed regular checkup date will be used"
  )
  public void no_supportingCalculators_nextMonthWillBeReturned() {
    // given: only not-supporting calculators are available for the Pet
    List<RegularCheckupDateCalculator> onlyNotSupportingCalculators =
        calculators(
            notSupporting(ONE_MONTHS_AGO)
        );
    // when:
    LocalDate nextRegularCheckup = calculate(onlyNotSupportingCalculators);
    // then: the default implementation will return next month
    assertThat(nextRegularCheckup)
        .isEqualTo(NEXT_MONTH);
  }

  /*
   * instantiates the SUT with the provided calculators as dependencies
   * and executes the calculation
   */
  private LocalDate calculate(
          List<RegularCheckupDateCalculator> calculators
  ) {
    RegularCheckupService service = new RegularCheckupServiceBean(
        timeSource,
        calculators
    );

    return service.calculateNextRegularCheckupDate(
        data.petWithType(data.waterType()),
        Lists.emptyList()
    );
  }
  // ...
}
----
<1> `PetclinicData` acts as a Test Utility Method holder. As no DB is present in the Unit test, it only creates transient objects
<2> `notSupporting` provides a Calculator that will not support the Pet (returns `false` for `supports(Pet pet)`)
<3> `supportingWithDate` provides a Calculator that supports the Pet (returns `true` for `supports(Pet pet)`) and returns the passed in Date as the result
<4> `calculate` is the method that contains the instantiation and execution of the service

The full source code including the helper methods and test implementation of the Calculator can be found in the example project: https://github.com/cuba-guides/cuba-petclinic-unit-testing/blob/master/modules/core/test/com/haulmont/sample/petclinic/service/visit/regular_checkup/RegularCheckupServiceTest.java[RegularCheckupServiceTest.java].


==== Testing the Calculators

As described above the unit test for the `RegularCheckupService` does not include the implementations of the different calculators itself. This is done on purpose in order to benefit from the isolation aspects and the localization of the test scenarios. Otherwise the `RegularCheckupServiceTest` would contain test cases for all the different calculators as well as the orchestration logic.

Splitting the test cases for the orchestration and the calculator allows us to create a comparably easy test case setup for testing one of the calculators. In this example we will take a look at the `ElectricPetTypeCalculator` and the corresponding test case.

For this calculator, that is responsible for Pets of type `Electric` it embodies the following business rules:

1. it should only be used if the name of the PetType is `Electric`, otherwise not
2. the interval between two regular Checkups is one year for electric pets
3. Visits that are not regular checkups should not influence the calculation
4. in case the Pet has not done a regular checkup at the Petclinic before, next month should be proposed
5. if the last Regular Checkup was performed longer than one year ago, next month should be proposed


==== ElectricPetTypeCalculator Test Cases

The implementation of the different test cases that verify those business rules can be found below. This test class also uses the `PetclinicData` helper for various test utility methods.

<1> `Supports` describes test cases of that verify the behavior of `support()` method via `@Nested` grouping of JUnit
<2> several static points in time are statically defined that are used as test fixtures and verification values
<3> `calculate` is executing the corresponding method of the calculator (SUT)

The test class uses the JUnit Annotation `@Nested`. This allows to define groups of test cases that all share the same context. In this case it is used to group them by the methods of the SUT that they test: `@Nested class Supports {}` for the `support()` method to verify. `@Nested class CalculateRegularCheckupDate` for the `calculate()` method of the API.

Furthermore the context definition is used to create certain test data as well as `@BeforeEach` setup methods only for all the test cases that are defined in that context. E.g. only in the context `CalculateRegularCheckupDate` it is necessary to define the `timeSource` mock behavior.

The two above shown test cases that we saw test the different sub parts of the implementation of the "Next Regular Checkup Date Calculation" into multiple parts. With that design choice in the tests and the implementation it allows to create test cases, that have a strong locality. This means in case one test case after a production change does not succeed anymore, it is easier and faster to find the root cause.

== Limitations of Unit Testing


== Summary

In this guide we learned how to use unit tests to test functionality in an isolated fashion using JUnit. In the introduction you saw the differences using plain unit tests compared to middleware integration tests. In particular no external dependencies like databases are used. Furthermore the test environment does not leverage a test container. Instead the SUT has to be instantiated manually.

In order to create isolated tests it is sometimes required to leverage a Mocking framework as we did in the `RegularCheckupServiceTest` example. Mocking is a way to control the environment & dependencies the SUT interacts with. By exchanging particular dependencies with special test implementations the test case is capable of setup the behavior of the dependency (and potentially use it for verification purposes as well). Mockito in the Java ecosystem allows to configure the dependencies and their desired behavior.

We also learned that exchanging field based injection with constructor based injection production code helps to manually inject dependencies into the SUT in testing scenarios.

The benefit of using plain unit tests over integration tests is that the tests run orders of magnitudes faster. This benefits sounds like a nice to have feature, but in fact it allows to go down a path of much more aggressive usage of automated testing. Using test driven development (TDD) as an example technique benefits very much from fast feedback cycles that those execution times provide.

Besides the benefits in the workflow of developing the test cases, we also learned about an architectural benefit: test scenario locality. Keeping the surface area of the SUT small helps to spot root causes of test failures much faster.

Finally the test fixture setup is normally easier to create as well when the surface area is kept small.

Besides the benefits we also looked at the limitations of unit testing. One example was that we are not able to verify the correct usage of particular environmental behavior the code lives in. Although our Unit tests perfectly show that the business rules might be correctly defined in the calculators, the question if the are using the correct Spring annotations to be picked up by the framework in the right way cannot easily be verified by unit tests.

Therefore using unit tests should only be used in combination with a set of integration tests that cover the remaining open questions. With this combination we can be quite sure that our application is actually working as we expect it.
