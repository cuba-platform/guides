In this guide you will learn how to create REST APIs for a CUBA application. We will explore mechanisms to create different types of APIs by adding Owner registration to the Petclinic as well as allow third-party applications to control the visit management.

== What we are going to build


This guide enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA Petclinic] example so that Owners can self-register online before the Visit. In the second example we will allow a third party Tablet application to do the Visit Management via a custom secured REST API.

== Overview

>> Topic: Motivation on why an API is a good idea

== What is a REST API

>> Topic: how do REST APIs in general work, small section

== How to create custom Controllers

>> Topic: a little bit Spring MVC Intro


== REST API for Petclinic

=== Public Registration Endpoint for creating Owners through a Website (Form Submit / JSON request)

* Custom Spring MVC Endpoint
* Custom JSON POJO


=== Secured Custom Partner API for managing Visits in third party application
* Using CUBAs OAuth2 security mechanism

==== Variant 1: using REST addon for generic exposure of Visit entity

==== Variant 2: Custom higher level API operations
* Create custom Request Objects for Visit Management (CreateVisitRequest, FinishTreatmentRequest, GetTreatmentStatusRequest)

==== Pros & Cons of using generic vs. custom API
