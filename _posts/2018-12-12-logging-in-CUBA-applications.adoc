In order to get insights into a running CUBA application, Logging is one crucial part to get in place. The Java ecosystem has a very mature mechanisms to do application logging. This guide show how this ecosystem can be leveraged in a CUBA application.

== What will be build

This guides enhances the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[CUBA petclinic] example to show how logging can be integrated, configured and viewed as part of the application itself or with the help of external tools.

== Why application logging is essential

Logging information about the running application is essential in order to get insights on how the application behaves, what unexpected behavior occurs and how the users are interacting with the system.

Logging is a common tool of application development and operation. The developer writes statements into the application source code indicating that certain actions happened.

In the following petclinic example two possible log messages are written. In case of a successful storage of the `Pet` instance, an informal message is written with the details of the pet that has been stored. In case of a failure of storing the Pet, an error message is written with information about the failure.


.PetServiceBean.java
[source,java]
----
private Pet savePet(Pet pet) {
    try {
      Pet savedPet = dataManager.commit(pet);
      log.info("Pet " + pet + " was saved correctly");
      return savedPet;
    }
    catch(Exception e) {
      log.error("Pet " + pet + " could not be saved", e);
      return null;
    }

}
----

Those messages will be written in a configured place that some administrator or developer has access to for later use. Normally this place is a plain text file, but it is also possible to store the logging information in a Database or a centralized logging service.

While the application is developed there is the ability to debug the source code. This gives the developer the ability to stop the application at any point in time and reason about its internal state.

For a running application this is normally not the case. Either because of security reasons or simply because the application is not run on a server that is under the control of the developer.

Therefore logging is the another tool in the toolbox of a developer in order to do diagnostics of a running application.

== The Java logging ecosystem

In the Java ecosystem logging has (as in a lot of other ecosystems as well) played a substantial role. There are various mechanisms and abstractions out there on how to actually interact with the logging mechanisms of the platform the application is running on.

Mainly these are various APIs of the JVM and different logging libraries that encapsulate the technical concern of logging to a file / database from the abstraction of "writing a log message".

In recent years a commonly used combination has been adopted in the Java ecosystem:

- Slf4J
- Logback

Slf4J is an abstract API that encapsulates the concrete details of the logging library. It offers different methods for logging information to the logging system with different servity levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` etc.).

Logback on the other hand is the logging library that fulfils this API and does the heavy lifting of writing the message to a log appender. A appender is a component within the logging library that takes a logging event created by the application developer and writes it to a specific output. Logback contains the options to configure how the logging system should behave, which log information go into which appender etc.

== How to log in a CUBA application

The usage of logging libraries within a CUBA application does not differ from other Java application in this regard. CUBA is by default configured with Sl4fJ and Logback in place. The framework itself uses them for framework internal logging messages.

In order to log information within a class, an instance of a Logger has to be created in the class that wants to log information.

.DiseaseWarningMailingServiceBean.java
[source,java]
----
@Service(DiseaseWarningMailingService.NAME)
public class DiseaseWarningMailingServiceBean implements DiseaseWarningMailingService {


  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DiseaseWarningMailingServiceBean.class); // <1>

  // ...

  @Override
  public int warnAboutDisease(PetType petType, String disease, String city) {

    log.debug("Disease warnings should be send out for Pet type: {}, Disease: {} in the area of {}", petType, disease, city); // <2>

    List<Pet> petsInDiseaseCity = findPetsInDiseaseCity(petType, city);
    List<Pet> petsWithEmail = filterPetsWithValidOwnersEmail(petsInDiseaseCity);

    log.debug("possible pets in danger: {}", petsWithEmail);

    petsWithEmail.forEach(pet -> sendEmailToPetsOwner(pet, disease, city));
    int amountOfInformedPets = petsWithEmail.size();

    log.info("Summary: Disease warning send out to {} Pet(s) in {}", amountOfInformedPets, city); // <3>

    return amountOfInformedPets;
  }


  // ...

}
----
<1> Logger configured for this class is defined through Slf4J
<2> write debug log message when `warnAboutDisease` is initiated
<3> write summary info message about the outcome of the method execution. Variable parts of the log message can be passed into the method as parameters and marked in the log message as the following placeholder: `{}`

=== View log messages through CUBA UI

There are several ways to get access to the log output of the running application. The most common way is a log file within the filesystem of the server. Unfortunately this oftentimes requires special permissions and knowledge to get access to the file.

CUBA offers a user interface screen, which displays the log information of the running application. It can be found via `Administration > Server Log > View`:

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuba-guides/cuba-petclinic-application-logging/master/img/cuba-server-log-messages.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuba-guides/cuba-petclinic-application-logging/master/img/cuba-server-log-messages.png"/></a>
++++

The UI allows the user to display different log files or download them for later use. It gives also non-administrator roles access to the logs, while it is still possible to restrict access only to allowed roles.

=== Logging Levels

Information that should be logged are of different types in multiple dimensions. In order to reason about the messages quickly and help the log message reader to distinguish between signal and noise, all logging libraries offer one very important dimension to categorize the messages: the Log level.

The log level can be seen as how critical / urgent the message is. It is important to note that the log levels ordered and are based on each other. Slf4J defines the following https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/apache/log4j/Level.html(logging levels) that can be used by in an application:

- TRACE
- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARN
- ERROR
- FATAL

The list is sorted by urgency descending. `DEBUG` log messages on the one end are normally used for information that help to identify the internal state of the application for application developers.

`ERROR` and `FATAL` are normally used in cases where an unexpected situation within the application occurred up to the point that the application cannot fulfil its purpose anymore.

== Adjust logging configuration

Logback (alongside with other logging libraries) allows customization on how and where the log information it processed and written to an output, mainly through the already mentioned `appender` concept.

Generally there are two options to adjust the configuration of logback. On the one side there is a configuration file called `logback.xml` where the configuration can be expressed. This adjustments happen at deployment time. Alternatively logback can (to a certain extend) be configured at runtime. CUBA offers a UI for adjusting logging configuration for this purpose (`Administration > Server Log > Options`).

=== At deployment: logback.xml configuration file

The configuration file `logback.xml` is the main place to adjust the configuration of logback. In a CUBA application this file is located in `deploy/tomcat/conf/logback.xml` (in case of https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-{cuba_version}/fast_deployment.html[fast deployment] option). It looks like this:


.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<configuration debug="false" packagingData="true">

    <property name="logDir" value="${catalina.base}/logs"/>

    <appender name="File" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender"> // <1>
        <file>${logDir}/app.log</file>

        <filter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.filter.ThresholdFilter">
            <level>DEBUG</level>
        </filter>

        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level [%thread%X{cubaApp}%X{cubaUser}] %logger - %msg%n</pattern> // <2>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <appender name="Console" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender"> // <3>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %-40logger{36}- %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root>
        <appender-ref ref="Console"/>
        <appender-ref ref="File"/>
    </root>

    <logger name="com.haulmont.sample.petclinic" level="DEBUG"/> // <4>
    <logger name="com.haulmont.cuba" level="DEBUG"/>
    <logger name="com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys" level="INFO"/>

    <!-- ... -->

</configuration>

----
<1> a file appender to write log messages to the logfile `app.log`
<2> `pattern` configures how a single log message line within the file should look like
<3> another appender writes the log messages to `STDOUT` (with different options)
<4> logging levels can be configured on a per class / package basis

CUBA by default configures multiple log appender. An appender describes where the log information should be written to. There are multiple appender available out of the box. Each appender has options to configure its behavior (like how the log message should be formatted, which information should be logged etc.). Common Log appender are `FileAppender` and `ConsoleAppender`.

The configuration of loggers allow to define the threshold on a per class / package basis. This means that for certain sub-parts of the application, it is possible to get log messages that have been written as `DEBUG` while for other parts it is only necessary to see log messages of `WARN` and `ERROR`.

In the example above the package `com.haulmont.sample.petclinic` is set to level `DEBUG`. This means, that it will output all log messages that have _at least_ the level `DEBUG`. Due to the semantic order of the log levels `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` and `FATAL` will also be logged for this package. `TRACE` log messages on the other hand will not be displayed.


=== At runtime: CUBA logging UI

Adjusting the configuration of the file requires a restart of the application. For temporary debugging sessions it is oftentimes helpful to not have to restart the server only to adjust the logging level or a certain subpart of the application code.

For this use-case a CUBA application allows to reconfigure the levels of existing loggers and also add loggers at runtime trough a user interface.

=== Set logging context with MDC

Once the application has certain amount of logging information certain information get repeated in a lot of logging messages. In the petclinic example a lot of log messages would contain the Pet ID in order to get the context information in a fast manner. For those kinds of information, there is a context in Logback, called _MDC_.

MDC allows to set certain values into a context, that gets logged every time alongside with the actual logging message. This way the context can be set once and the developer writing the actual logging statement does not need to include it into the log message anymore.

In the example of the petclinic, the `PetContactFetcherBean` leverages the MDC context in the following manner: Directly after invoking the method `Optional<Contact> findContact(Pet pet)` the identification number of the Pet is set into the MDC context like this:


.PetContactFetcherBean.java
[source,java]
----
@Component(PetContactFetcher.NAME)
public class PetContactFetcherBean implements PetContactFetcher {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PetContactFetcherBean.class);


    @Override
    public Optional<Contact> findContact(Pet pet) {

        MDC.put("petId", pet.getIdentificationNumber()); // <1>

        log.debug("Searching Contact for Pet"); // <2>

        Optional<Owner> petOwner = loadOwnerFor(pet);

        if (petOwner.isPresent()) {
            log.debug("Found Owner: {}", petOwner);

            // ...

            if (isAvailable(telephone)) {
                return createContact(telephone, ContactType.TELEPHONE);
            }

            // ...

        } else {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
    }

    private Optional<Contact> createContact(String contactValue, ContactType contactType) {

        Contact contact = new Contact();
        contact.setValue(contactValue);
        contact.setType(contactType);

        log.info("Contact created: {}", contact); // <3>

        MDC.remove("petId"); // <4>

        return Optional.of(contact);
    }

    // ...

}

----
<1> the Pets identification number is registered in the context under the key `petId`
<2> the following logging messages do not need to include the Pet ID within the log message itself
<3> the lifetime of a value in the MDC is independent of method boundaries
<4> the key `petId` of the MDC is cleaned up at the end of the method


Now that the MDC has values in it, the next step is to reconfigure logback in order to see the dedicated MDC values in the log output.


.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<configuration debug="false" packagingData="true">

    <!-- ... -->

    <appender name="File" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">

        <!-- ... -->

        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level [%thread%X{cubaApp}%X{cubaUser}] [Pet: %X{petId}] %logger - %msg%n</pattern> // <1>
        </encoder>

    </appender>

    <!-- ... -->

</configuration>

----
<1> `%X{petId}` takes the value with the key `petId` of the MDC and writes it to the log file


The resulting logging output contains the Pet identification number:

[source,bash]
----
2018-12-13 08:54:41.345 DEBUG [http-nio-8080-exec-7/petclinic/admin] [Pet: 205] c.h.s.p.c.PetContactFetcherBean - Searching Contact for Pet
2018-12-13 08:54:41.354 DEBUG [http-nio-8080-exec-7/petclinic-core/admin] [Pet: 205] c.h.c.c.a.RdbmsStore - load: metaClass=petclinic_Owner, id=79fa17b9-a130-207d-5091-f79cceb9cf99, view=com.haulmont.sample.petclinic.entity.owner.Owner/_local
2018-12-13 08:54:41.371 DEBUG [http-nio-8080-exec-7/petclinic/admin] [Pet: 205] c.h.s.p.c.PetContactFetcherBean - Found Owner: Optional[com.haulmont.sample.petclinic.entity.owner.Owner-79fa17b9-a130-207d-5091-f79cceb9cf99 [detached]]
2018-12-13 08:54:41.374 INFO  [http-nio-8080-exec-7/petclinic/admin] [Pet: 205] c.h.s.p.c.PetContactFetcherBean - Contact created: TELEPHONE: 0049817312
----

The log entries now contain the following part of the message: `[Pet: 205]`. This context entry is also used for CUBA internal logging messages like the logging message of the `RdbmsStore`.

MDC has the following advantages over putting context values directly into the log message:

- log messages are homogeneous for all logging messages
- log messages are structured allowing for explicit search
- the definition of the context can be extracted into a single place of the source code


== Logging to centralized Logging solution

Having very detailed information about the execution of the running application is very important. But having to deal with a huge amount of log data is challenging. Storing this information in the filesystem of the server is not very accessible and also not very efficient to work with. This is why oftentimes centralized logging solutions are used for storing and accessing the log information.

A very common open source centralized logging system is based on Elasticsearch - an full text search data store that turned out to be a great fit for the logging use case.

Logback integrates easily with centralized logging solutions via the concept of appender. In the configuration file there were already two appender configured for the application: `ConsoleAppender` and `FileAppender`.

For Elasticsearch there is a Logback Appender, that will directly send the logging information to the elasticsearch cluster instead of putting the log messages into a file. There are different option on how to configure logging to Elasticsearch (aka ELK-Stack). As this guide mainly deals with the integration with Logback within the application, configuring the Elasticsearch server in a production ready way is out of scope.

In order to use Elasticsearch as a log storage backend a dependency needs to be added to the CUBA application. In the `build.gradle` file the following dependency has to be added to _all_ modules: `runtime "com.internetitem:logback-elasticsearch-appender:1.6"`

The `logback.xml` configuration file should be extended to contain an additional appender:

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<configuration debug="false" packagingData="true">

    <!-- ... -->

    <appender name="elasticsearch" class="com.internetitem.logback.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchAppender"> // <1>
        <url>${ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_URL}</url> // <2>
        <index>cuba-petclinic-logs-%date{yyyy-MM-dd}</index> // <3>
        <type>cuba-petclinic</type>
        <errorLoggerName>es-error-logger</errorLoggerName>
        <includeMdc>true</includeMdc>
        <properties>
            <property>
                <name>host</name>
                <value>${HOSTNAME}</value>
                <allowEmpty>false</allowEmpty>
            </property>
            <property>
                <name>severity</name>
                <value>%level</value>
            </property>
            <property>
                <name>thread</name>
                <value>%thread</value>
            </property>
            <property>
                <name>logger</name>
                <value>%logger</value>
            </property>
            <property>
                <name>stacktrace</name>
                <value>%ex</value>
            </property>
        </properties>
    </appender>


    <!-- ... -->

</configuration>

----
<1> an `elasticsearch` appender of type `ElasticsearchAppender` is registered for the application
<2> the URL of the elasticsearch cluster is extracted form the environment variables
<3> The elasticsearch index for the application logs is `cuba-petclinic-logs-%date{yyyy-MM-dd}` with a daily rotation

With that configuration in place, the application will take the log messages and send them to elasticsearch. Kibana as a user interface for accessing data in elasticsearch is capable of displaying the log information properly. Via the structured as well as full text search capabilities, the log information can be accessed in a much easier way compared to direct access to the log files.

== Summary

Logging is an essential part for developers and administrators to reason about a running application. It enables developers to observe a system through opening up the "black-box" and get valuable insights. The use cases go from debugging over performance analysis to observing user behavior.

The logging facilities in the Java and CUBA ecosystem are very mature and can be used without any friction. But as the logging API is so generic and usable in multiple ways, it heavily depends on conventions in order to get qualitative logging messages in the application. There are different mechanisms to not get overwhelmed by raw logging messages through proper logging configuration, diagnosis contexts (MDC) and logging levels.

CUBA offers an opinionated way of dealing with logging configuration and access to logs. But as it is based on standard Java logging mechanism it plays nicely with other solutions like centralized logging systems.
