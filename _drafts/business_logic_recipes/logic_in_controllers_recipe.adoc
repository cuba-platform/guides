If we want to run the discount calculation when a user clicks a button on the customer's browser screen, the most straightforward way to accomplish this is to put the calculation logic right in the browser <<screen_controller,screen controller>>.

See the *Calculate discount* button in the demo application and the screen controller implementation: {proj_business_logic}/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/company/sample/web/ex1/customer/CustomerBrowse.java[CustomerBrowse.java]. Please keep in mind that the provided calculation process is not optimal and see more options in the <<data_recipes>> section.

This approach is acceptable if the logic is invoked from a single point and it is not too complex to fit into a couple of short methods.
