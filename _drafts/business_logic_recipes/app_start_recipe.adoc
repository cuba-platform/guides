==== Running Code on Startup

Sometimes you need to run some code on the application startup, at the moment when all application functionality is already initialized and ready to work. For this, you can use <<app_lifecycle_events,application lifecycle event listeners>>.

In this section we demonstrate how to dynamically register an <<entity_listeners,entity listener>> on application startup. Consider the following task: a project has an `Employee` entity that is linked one-to-one to the platform's `User` entity.

If the `name` attribute of the `User` entity is changed, for example, through a standard user management screen, the `name` attribute of the related `Employee` should change as well. This is a common task for "denormalized" data, which is typically solved using entity listeners. Our case is more complicated, since we need to track changes of the platform's `User` entity, and thus we cannot add an entity listener using the <<listeners_annotation,@Listeners>> annotation. So we will add a listener dynamically using the `EntityListenerManager` bean on application start.

* {proj_business_logic}/blob/master/modules/core/src/com/company/sample/core/AppLifecycle.java[AppLifecycle.java] - a middleware bean listening to the `AppContextInitializedEvent` events.

* {proj_business_logic}/blob/master/modules/core/src/com/company/sample/listener/UserEntityListener.java[UserEntityListener.java] - an entity listener for the `User` entity.

As a result, the `initEntityListeners()` method of the `AppLifecycle` class will be invoked on the middleware <<app_tiers,block>> startup. This method registers the `sample_UserEntityListener` bean as an entity listener for the `User` entity.

The `onBeforeUpdate()` method of the `UserEntityListener` class will be invoked every time before the changes in the `User` instances are saved to the database. The method checks if the `name` attribute exists among the updated attributes. If yes, a related `Employee` instance is loaded and its `name` is updated with the new value.
