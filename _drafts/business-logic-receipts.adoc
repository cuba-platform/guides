=== Organizing Business Logic

When you start developing on the platform, one of the first questions is "where should I put my business logic"? Using Studio for creating data model and CRUD screens is simple, but any real project requires some logic beyond CRUD. This section explains how you can effectively organize your business logic depending on your requirements.

Most examples in this section work with the following data model:

In these examples, we will calculate discounts for customers based on total amount of their purchases.

== Summary

There are several options when it comes to where to put the business logic in a CUBA application. A controller can be a good and easy start, although it has some downsides when it comes to sharing code. A client bean solves this problem to some degree. Middleware services allow for sharing business logic across different clients (e.g. Polymer Client) and is the most appropriate way of putting business logic.

The decision where to put the business logic for a given case should be done on a case to case basis.
